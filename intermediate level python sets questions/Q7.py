"""Remove all elements from a set.

Given the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, clear all the elements using the clear() method.
Check if two sets have no common elements.

Check if sets {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} have no common elements.
Create a set of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using set comprehension.

Write a set comprehension to generate a set of squares of numbers between 1 and 10.

Given the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, convert it into a list.
Advanced Level
Create a set of unique words from a string.

Write code to extract the unique words from the string "hello world, hello Python" and store them in a set.
Create a set and update it with another set.

Given sets {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5}, update the first set with elements of the second.
Use set operations to determine if two sets are disjoint.

Check if the sets {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are disjoint.
Create a set of common characters between two strings.

Given the strings "apple" and "orange", find the common characters using sets.
Check if a set is a superset of another set without using built-in methods.

Write code to check if {1, 2, 3, 4} is a superset of {2, 3} without using the issuperset() method.
Perform set difference and union in a single expression.

Given sets {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}, find the difference and union in a single line.
Find the Cartesian product of two sets.

Find the Cartesian product of sets {1, 2} and {a, b}.
Create a set of even numbers between 1 and 50, excluding multiples of 5, using set comprehension.

Write a set comprehension that generates the set of even numbers from 1 to 50 but excludes multiples of 5.
Check if a set is disjoint with another set and output a custom message.

Given sets {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6}, write code that prints "No common elements" if they are disjoint, and "Common elements found" otherwise.
